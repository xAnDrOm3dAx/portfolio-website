        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Christopher Werkmeister, a web developer based in Brisbane, Australia.</p>

        <p>
          My current personal interests include: being outdoorsy, cycling, self development, herbalism, coding, arts & design, and gardening. I am a certified
          plant nerd with a basic knowledge of fungal biology, and like a dead tree to mycelium, this knowledge is expanding rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
          I come from a diverse background and have gained extensive experience in various fields throughout my life, including visual arts, sales, retail
          management, hospitality, tourism, construction and engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          I consider myself an adaptable, creative and highly versatile individual with a hunger for self-education. I have a passion for creating pixel perfect
          and visually appealing websites, and I take pride in writing concise, efficient code. I'm constantly seeking ways to enhance my knowledge in this
          field and although I don't have extensive or real-world experience yet, my passion and drive to learn make up for it. I'm a team player, a
          self-sufficient learner, I value integrity, quality, and efficiency, and I'm confident that my unique combination of skills, personality traits, and
          past experience will be an asset to any development team.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm excited with the prospect to take on new challenges and contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact and I'm currently open to any
          opportunities to join a company as an intern or entry level dev where I can apply my skills to real-world projects.
        </p>
